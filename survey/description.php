							<td>The school community as a whole engages the students in a highly meaningful and English immersive environment. Students are provided with highly challenging and enjoyable learning experiences. All students have the opportunity to participate in English language activities both in and out of class. The School Head is actively creating an immersive English environment, is a constant motivator and ensures sustainability of ELT activities.  Teachers are frequently and systematically exposing students to English language learning activities both in and out of class. This is by creating varied enrichment and remedial activities that are used to address the diverse abilities and strengthen students' confidence in using English. Teachers are excellent role models of language use. The school actively engages in outreach activities through alumni, engagement with ELT experts from higher learning institutions and corporate bodies. Parents’ involvement is seen clearly in planning, organising and supporting the school in ELT activities.</td>

							<td>The school community as a whole engages the students in a good and meaningful English immersive environment. Students are provided with some challenging and enjoyable learning experiences. A large number of students have the opportunity to participate in English language activities both in and out of class. The School Head manages to create an immersive English environment. There is evidence of the sustainability of some ELT activities. Teachers manage to expose students to English language learning activities both in and out of class; however this may not be varied in terms of enrichment and remedial activities. The activities used are only sometimes able to strengthen students' confidence in using English occasionally. Teachers and students do not communicate in English frequently. There is some evidence of the school’s engagement in outreach activities through alumni, engagement with ELT experts from higher learning institutions and corporate bodies. Parents’ involvement is sometimes seen in supporting the school in ELT activities.</td>

							<td>The school community as a whole tries to engage the students in an English environment but may not be consistent. Students are provided with some English language activities but these may not be challenging and may not create enjoyable learning experiences. Few students have the opportunity to participate in English language activities both in and out of class. The School Head attempts to create an English environment with minimal success. Activities in English are carried out but there is little evidence of their sustainability. Teachers attempt to expose students to English language learning activities both in and out of class, however they lack the knowledge on how to organise the activities to improve student outcomes. The activities used do not always strengthen students' confidence in using English. Teachers and students communicate minimally in English. There is evidence of the school’s engagement in outreach activities but with a limited scope (involving only one party). Parents’ involvement is not frequent in supporting the school in ELT activities.</td>

							<td>The school community as a whole lacks the development of an English environment. School provides very little or no challenging and enjoyable learning experiences to students.  Students have little or no opportunity for extensive participation in English language activities both in and out of class. The School Head is hardly involved in English language activities and is not actively creating an immersive English environment.  School Head plays minimal role as a motivator for ELT activities. Most English activities conducted in the school are one off and do not show evidence of sustainability. There is a lack of frequent and systematic exposure for students to use the English language in and out of class. There is also a lack of awareness of students’ diverse abilities and students' confidence in using English.  There is hardly evidence of enrichment and remedial activities to address student participation in English language use. The school lacks active engagement in outreach activities through its alumni, engagement with ELT experts from higher learning institutions and corporate bodies. Parents’ involvement is hardly or not seen at all in planning, organising and supporting the school in ELT activities.</td>
